Purpose of project:
Create an app that allows you to post content to multiple social medias apps, including facebook, snapchat, twitter, and/or tiktok using their respective apis without having to draft and create a post for every single app.

Destin's Role: In this project I was on the backend developing team with small dips in front end work. We utilized the dart language on the flutter framework, through the medium of android studio to design and code the app and we handled our database functionality with firebase.
